We are creating an app that connects to user spotify and return a wordcloud of user's top song lyrics

These are the steps to make the initial app -

1. Connecting with user Spotify
2. Extracting top songs of user through Spotify API
3. Getting lyrics of top songs using Genius / Musixmatch API
4. Displaying Wordcloud to users


Once we have enough data, we will work on (mostly likely) a matching algorithm to connect users with similar lyrics.
